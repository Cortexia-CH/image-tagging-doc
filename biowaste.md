# Biowaste

For this projects, you will tag anomalies in images of compost.

### :page_facing_up: Biowaste instructions:

1. Observe carefully the image to find any object of the categories. There are a lot of things in those images so take your time to find any anomaly in the image.

2. You'll see a lot of plastic food pacckaging. Those are not considered as anomalies.

3. When a whole object is split in two because there's another object in front of it masking part of it, please draw both parts separately and then use the "same object" relation to indicate that both parts go together.

4. Please do not skip any of the imagee.


### Categories descriptions
Please read very carefully and entirely!
The tags on those images are means to help you recognize the categories. Please do not take the shaping as example, it was really roughly done and we expect a finer work.
